# Predicting-NRA-membership
# Jagadeeshwari_FE (2).ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is part of the **Predicting-NRA-membership** project. It is primarily focused on feature engineering for predictive modeling tasks related to NRA membership.

## Contents

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering steps
- Data transformation and cleaning
- (Optional) Model training and evaluation

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Follow the code cells in order, adjusting data paths as necessary.
3. Review outputs after each section to understand the feature engineering process.
4. The notebook can be adapted for use with similar datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizations)
- scikit-learn (for data processing or modeling steps)
- (Add any other libraries used in the notebook)

## How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook "Jagadeeshwari_FE (2).ipynb"
```
or open directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Project Context

This notebook is a key step in preparing data for predicting NRA membership, and should be run after initial data collection. The feature engineering performed here is critical for improving model performance.
